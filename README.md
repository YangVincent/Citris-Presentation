# Citris Presentation

This was my initial website for the second round of Citris's Mobile App Competition. This project shows the front-end for EVENTR, my application 
that aggregates data from a multitude of sources to provide university students with a clean, easily accessable resource helping with 
their job searches and professional development opportunities.

This project went on to win 2nd place, with $2,000 dollars. The final results can be found [here](http://citris-uc.org/students-design-and-demo-mobile-apps-to-benefit-society-at-uc-davis/).
